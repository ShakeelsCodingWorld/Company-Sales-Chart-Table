📦 Ship To It - Company Packing List
Hey there! Welcome to Ship To It — a sleek little webpage that organizes and displays a company’s packing and shipping list using clean HTML and CSS. If you’re just starting out in web development, this project is a great example of how HTML tables + CSS styling can come together to present information in a clear and stylish way. 😎

🧠 What This Project Is
This project is a responsive table layout showing:

Company names

The number of items each needs to ship

The next action for each shipment

It also includes:

A styled navigation bar

A placeholder search box (just for looks in this version 😉)

A footer row in the table showing the total number of items

🎓 What I Learned
